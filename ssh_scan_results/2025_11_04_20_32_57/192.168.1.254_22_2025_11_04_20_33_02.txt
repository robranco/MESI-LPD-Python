Key exchange algorithms (kex_algorithms):
  - curve25519-sha256@libssh.org (strong - Libssh.org Curve25519 (2014) w/ SHA-256; aligns with NIST >=128-bit recommendations.)
  - diffie-hellman-group14-sha256 (strong - 2048-bit MODP Group14 + SHA-256 (2014 refresh) satisfies NIST 112-bit baseline. [NIST: https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-56a/rev-3/final])
  - diffie-hellman-group16-sha512 (strong - 4096-bit MODP Group16 + SHA-512 exceeds NIST Level 1 (112-bit) recommendations. [NIST: https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-56a/rev-3/final])

Host key algorithms (server_host_key_algorithms):
  - ecdsa-sha2-nistp521 (strong - ECDSA P-521 (2009) ~256-bit, aligned with NIST Level 3. [NIST: https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/fips/186/5/final])
  - ssh-rsa (weak - RSA with SHA-1 (2006); fails NIST guidance due to SHA-1 collisions. [NIST: https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-131a/rev-2/final])
  - ssh-dss (weak - DSA limited to 1024-bit modulus (1994); below NIST minimum 112-bit strength. [NIST: https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-131a/rev-2/final])

Offered ciphers (client->server):
  - aes256-ctr (strong - AES-256 (2001) in CTR mode; 256-bit key gives long-term strength. [NIST: https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-38a/final])
  - aes128-ctr (strong - AES-128 (2001) in CTR mode; 128-bit key remains strong when paired with modern MACs. [NIST: https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-38a/final])
  - aes256-cbc (weak - AES-256 (2001) in CBC mode; padding oracles and lack of integrity make it risky. [NIST: https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-38a/final])
  - twofish256-cbc (weak - Older (pre-2005) design with limited block size or known attacks (e.g., padding or keystream biases).)
  - aes128-cbc (weak - AES-128 (2001) in CBC mode; prone to padding-oracle attacks without extra mitigations. [NIST: https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-38a/final])
  - twofish-cbc (weak - Twofish (1998) but used in CBC without authentication; better options exist today.)

  - CVE-2017-9078: https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-9078 - The server in Dropbear before 2017.75 might allow post-authentication root remote code execution because of a double free in cleanup of TCP listeners when the -a option is enabled.
  - CVE-2017-9079: https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-9079 - Dropbear before 2017.75 might allow local users to read certain files as root, if the file has the authorized_keys file format with a command= option. This occurs because ~/.ssh/authorized_keys is read with root privileges and symlinks are followed.
